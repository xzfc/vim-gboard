*gboard.txt*            `gt` - goto clipboard

INTRODUCTION                                             *gboard*

Edit the file whose name is found in the clipboard, similar to |gf| (goto file).
Lets you quickly jump to a file mentioned in another terminal window.

FILE AND LINE MATCHING                                   *gboard-match*

Gboard searches the contents of |"*| and |"+| registers for file names and line
numbers produced by common command-line tools.  The selection does not need to
be precise, as long as the file path is present somewhere.  Particularly, the
following match patterns are supported:

• Whole register content is a file name.

• File name with optional line and column numbers, e.g.:
    `foo.txt`
    `foo.txt:10`
    `foo.txt:10:5`
  Might appear anywhere in the register contents.

• Multi-line grep-like output, in which the heading (file name) is followed
  by lines prefixed by line numbers.

  For example, the following register contents >
    $ rg -wC1 SetCookie
    src/btree.c
    10392-** The schema layer numbers meta values differently.  At the schema
    10393:** layer (and the SetCookie and ReadCookie opcodes) the number of
    10394-** free pages is not visible.  So Cookie[0] is the same as Meta[1].

    src/vdbe.c
    4227-
    4228:/* Opcode: SetCookie P1 P2 P3 * P5
    4229-**
<  matches `src/btree.c:10394` and `src/vdbe.c:4229` (last mentioned line number
  for each paragraph).

  Possible delimiters between line number and text are:
    `:` `-`           produced by `rg`
    `│` (U+2502)    produced by `ast-grep`


Prefixes added by `git diff` (`a/` and `b/`) might be stripped.  E.g., the following
line produced by `git log -p` >
    +++ b/src/main.c
matches `b/src/main.c`, and `src/main.c`.  Aside: you might want to configure git
to not include these prefixes by setting `diff.noPrefix`, but this plugin does
not require it.

gb                      Edit the file whose name is found in the clipboard.
                        Mnemonic: "Goto clipBoard".  Similar to |gf|.

gB                      Like `gb`, but in a new tab.
                        Similar to |CTRL-W_f|. (sorry, |CTRL-W_b| is taken by vim)

                                                        *gboard-CTRL-W_gb*
CTRL-W gb               Like `gb`, but in a split.
                        Similar to |CTRL-W_gf|.


If you prefer to set your own mappings instead, set *g:gboard_no_maps*, e.g. >
    let g:gboard_no_maps = 1
    nmap gy         <Plug>(gboard)
    nmap <CTRL-W>y  <Plug>(gboard:split)
    nmap <C-W>gy    <Plug>(gboard:tabedit)
See the source for the full list of <Plug> mappings.
